        <h3>Ethic Hacking</h3>
        <p>
          Nmap is an essential tool in an ethical hacker's arsenal. It allows you to explore 
          networks, discover devices and services, and evaluate the security of computer 
          systems. With its advanced scanning capabilities, Nmap provides crucial information
          to identify vulnerabilities and strengthen the security of a network, all within 
          established ethical and legal boundaries.

        <h3>Like Developer Full Stack</h3>
        <p>
          My main focus is developing web and mobile applications that are not only functional, 
          but also intuitive and attractive to the user. I love working as a team, collaborating 
          with other professionals and facing new challenges that allow me to grow both personally and professionally.
          With a solid training in a Bootcamp of more than 850 hours, I am always looking 
          to learn new technologies and adopt the best development practices. I firmly believe
          in the importance of continuous learning and constant improvement.

        <h3>Like cybersecurity and pentesting</h3>
        <p>
          a cybersecurity analyst specialized in penetration testing (pentesting). 
          My job consists of identifying and correcting vulnerabilities in computer 
          systems and networks to prevent possible cyber attacks.

          As a pentester, I use advanced techniques to evaluate the security of systems,
          simulating real hacker attacks to discover security gaps and weak points in an organization's IT infrastructure.
          
          My goal is to help companies strengthen their cyber defenses and protect their digital assets against
           potential threats. I work closely with information security teams to implement effective solutions 
           and continually improve the organization's security posture.
          
          If you are interested in strengthening the security of your company and protecting it against possible 
          cyber attacks, do not hesitate to contact me!

        <h3>Like Network administrator</h3>
        <p>
          My primary focus is designing and maintaining networks that meet the operational and 
          business needs of the organization, ensuring that users have quick and secure access 
          to necessary resources. From configuring routers and switches to managing firewalls 
          and troubleshooting connectivity issues, I enjoy tackling the technical challenges 
          that arise in the world of networking.
          In addition to my technical experience, I value collaboration and effective 
          communication with other teams and stakeholders. I believe in working closely with colleagues 
          from different departments to understand and address their network needs proactively and efficiently.

        <h3>And as person</h3>
        <p>
          I enjoy working as a team and firmly believe in the power of collaboration to achieve common goals. 
          My ability to listen, communicate ideas and support my colleagues has allowed me to contribute significantly
          to successful projects, where teamwork is essential to overcome obstacles and achieve success.
          Outside of the professional sphere, my passion for music inspires and motivates me. I enjoy exploring different
          musical genres, attending concerts and playing instruments in my free time. Music not only brings me joy and entertainment, 
          but it also helps me stay creative and focused on my daily tasks.
          Additionally, I am an enthusiastic traveler who enjoys exploring new cultures, discovering incredible 
          places and broadening my perspective of the world. Travel allows me to get out of my comfort zone, learn
          from new experiences and connect with people from all over the world.
          In short, I am a person committed to teamwork, passionate about music, and passionate about exploring the 
          world through travel. I am excited for the opportunities the future may bring and am ready to face new challenges with an open mind and resilient spirit.
